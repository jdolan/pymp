 - The spacebar can be used to pause items now.
 - Added scrollbar support to playlist

Version 1.0
----

 - Added time to progress bar since MPlayer finally supports it.  Users with
   older MPlayers should still get the percentage readout.
 - Removed popup tip. A proper implementation of the widgets required to do
   this correctly is slated for gtk+ 2.12, at which time I'll revisit it.
 - Starting pymp with targets specified on the command line now checks for a
   running instance and remotely adds targets, rather than starting a new
   instance.  This is very handy if you open a playlist while you're listening
   to something else.
 - Added Gtk AboutDialog, ability to visit website via click.
 - Fixed small non-crash bug when quitting while not playing a track.


Version 0.9
----

 - Added .pls playlist file support
 - Popup tip only shows with user event
 - Playlist scrolls with mouse wheel
 - Many new key controls:
   <, > previous, next target
   <left>, <right> rewind, forward
   s, p stop, pause
 - New Gtk+ 2.6 stock buttons in control panel
 - Url targets are no longer basename'd
