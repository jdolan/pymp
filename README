Pymp is a simple, clean Gtk2 interface for MPlayer.  It supports 
any media type MPlayer does, and has nice features like:

-Opening files on the command line: pymp *.mp3

-Open files or locations, i.e.: http://x.com/foo.avi, dvd://1

-Drag and drop files or folders to playlist

-Remote commands on a running instance:
	pymp -remote pause
	pymp -remote stop
	pymp -remote play 12
	pymp -remote status
	pymp -remote seek 20

-Simple playlist format:
	find ~/ -name "*.mp3" > playlist.m3u

-Auto save/restore last playlist

-Continuous, random, and repeat play

-Interactive progress bar

-Find file in list: <ctrl+f>

-Really freakin' tiny
